# Personal site (WIP) #

Project was started with create-react-app. and Hosted on netlify
- use npm install to install project dependencies
- use npm start to develop locally.
- netlify is configured to deploy automatically from the the build folder in the deploy branch.

## Why Netlify? ##

I've only recently come across netlify and I'm honestly blown away.

- They offer totally free static site hosting. 
- Git integrated deploy enviroment. 
- Teams and site project managements systems.
- A Really modern, clean interface.

As the modern web starts to lean toward Node based stacks, a server side language is no longer required to have complex and content heavy sites when using a library like react and a simple cms like netlify or ghost.
